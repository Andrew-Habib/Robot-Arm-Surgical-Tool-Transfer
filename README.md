"# Robot-Arm-Surgical-Tool-Transfer" 
McMaster University ENG 1P13 Project made using Python

Project Summary:
The problem present within this project was the lack of access to healthcare, especially for those living in rural areas. A potential solution is through remote surgery or remote mentoring which allows people without a medical background to perform surgical procedures themselves. Within this project, my team was responsible for designing a solution to transfer surgical tools to appropriate autoclaves. The computing sub-team was responsible for designing the program through python that would allow the robot to securely pick up and drop off containers to their appropriate containers. 

This is the computer program written by myself and the computing another member of the computing team which is responsible for securely picking up a surgical tool container and transporting it to the appropriate autoclave location.
